Round 4 Methodology:

1) Right off the bat, we noticed “Session Traversal Utilities for NAT” (STUN) traffic in the Protocol Hierarchy.  We reviewed this traffic using the ‘stun’ filter.
	STUN traffic shows up in packet ‘6540’

2) Using the “Follow UDP Stream” option, we happened across the hostname.
	To find it quickly, search for “@127.0.0.1” in the stream

Yeah, that was easy – drpoppins-735
