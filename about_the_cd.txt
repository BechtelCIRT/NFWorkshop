At CactusCon 2015, I handed out 40 copies of the LMG Security's Network Forensics Puzzle Challenge 2014 DVD.  If you received one, great!

At BSides San Francisco 2015, the relevant files were distributed via a local network share.  If you received the files this way ("unencrypted" folder), great!

If you did not receive the associated PCAP files at one of these cons, FEAR NOT!  You can obtain the materials directly from LMG Security: http://bytepuzzles.com/products/network-forensics-puzzle-2014.

The TrueCrypt volumes on the official LMG Security DVD require passwords.
Please note that zeroes are often used instead of the letter 'o.'
